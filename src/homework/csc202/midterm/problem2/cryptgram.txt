A Tool to Perform Item Analysis to Enhance the Teaching and Learning Experiences
ADSTRACT: Assessment is one of the most essential educational tools. When properly developed and interpreted, assessments can help instructors better understand what their students are learning, identify specific areas which need clarification, and hence improve both teaching and learning experiences. Item analysis is a widely used tool to assess learning outcomes. It provides the means to gather evidence about students? knowledge on specific topics or knowledge areas. It can be used to identify students? strengths and weakness, monitor student learning and progress, and plan and conduct instruction. However, due to cumbersomeness of calculating relevant statistics, some best practices in item analysis are too infrequently used in actual practice. This paper describes an embedded item analysis tool that is integrated into the online programming assignment management and auto-grading system, and how it is used to assess students? learning outcomes and enhance teaching and learning experiences.
